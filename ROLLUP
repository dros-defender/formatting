ROLL UP
Reason for rollup - MUST INCLUDE PERTINENT DETAILS ON THE CASE, TO INCLUDE CUSTOMER NAME. The details submitted here should reflect similar details to a Completed Analyst Summary so that it’s known exactly what activity is occurring for the rollup. Examples:

Customer Name: <insert customer name>
Example:Different host but same activity related to the customer requesting investigation packages on the involved hosts, thus triggering a "RegSecurityDump" involving the Bitdefender Filepath. The reasoning for the customer requesting this investigation package for this host "MAURELJU" is that we included this host in the most recent periodic hunt mitigation recommendation, most likely the customer is running additional investigations using it.

Customer Name: <insert customer name>
Example:Same activity for PowerShell heuristic detections generated by CentraStage deployment scripts across the environment.
